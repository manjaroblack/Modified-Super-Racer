These config files are for my highly modified FLSun Super Racer.

Modifications include:
  Custom PLA Effector
  OMG V2 Extruder
  2x 5015 Blower Fans
  B-metal heatbreak

Planned modificaitons:
  Mosquito Magnum (prototyping a new effector)
  Beacon ABL (also prototyping in the new effector)

Movement limitations:
  400mm/s @ 240,000mm/s<sup>2</sup>
  1000mm/s @ 23,000mm/s<sup>2</sup>

Typical print profile workflow:
  Calibrate my filament for maximum quality
  Find the maximum flow of the filament while maintaining quality, typically 10-20% less than true maximum
  Set the maximum flow for the filament in my slicer, usually OrcaSlicer
  Set initial layer height to 0.45
  Set other layers to 0.15mm
  Set other print settings as needed, this should result in most of the print at maximum flow for the filament
